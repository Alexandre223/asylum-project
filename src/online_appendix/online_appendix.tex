\section{Data Appendix}
In the data appendix we explain in detail the sources for the data we use as well as any calculations or modifications that we do with the data before the analysis. 

\subsection{Asylum data}
All data on asylum applications and first-time asylum applications as well as on asylum decisions and their outcomes is taken from Eurostat.[CITE EUROSTAT 2018 a, b, c, d, e, f ...]. 

As there have been some changes in the data collection procedure in 2008, all data is available from Eurostat separately for the years until 2007 and for the years 2008 to 2014. We combine the data for all years and conduct a robustness check to show that any differences in the data collection methods do not drive our results. Data on asylum applications and first-time applications for all years and decision data up to 2007 are available only on the monthly and not on the quarterly level. Where data is available on the monthly level, we collapse the data on the quarterly level treating all quarters where information is not available for all months as missing. 

For the selection of the 12 destination countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom) we used the following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We use only countries for which first-time application data is available in at least 44 out of the 52 quarters from Q1 2002 to Q4 2014.
	\item From these countries we exclude those that only received few first-time asylum applications to avoid having many quarters with 0 first-time applications. More precisely we keep only countries that have in total at least 30000 first-time applications in the time period 2002 to 2014.
	\item We exclude Cyprus, even though it fulfils the other two requirements because of several irregular cabinet changes.\footnote{We also conduct a robustness check where we include Cyprus as a destination country, which shows that our main results still hold. The regression results for that robustness check are available from the authors on request.}
\end{enumerate}   

Moreover we restrict the number of origin countries the top 90\% in terms of total first-time applications between 2002 and 2014. This leaves us with the following 51 origin countries. 

\begin{table}[!ht]\centering \footnotesize

		\multicolumn{4}{p{14.3cm}}{Note: Not all origin countries are in the sample of origin countries for all years 2002 to 2014. Former Serbia and Montenegro is in the sample from 2002 to 2006. Serbia is in the sample from 2007 onwards and Kosovo is in the sample from 2009 onwards. When calculating the top 90\% origin countries we do not correct for the fact that these countries are not in the sample for the entire time period. }
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In order to avoid having many quarters with 0 first-time applications, we exclude all country pairs which have less than 2 first-time applications per quarter on average. This leaves us with 480 out of the 612 possible country pairs (12 destination countries * 51 origin countries). In order to show that our results are not sensitive to this cut-off, we also conduct robustness checks where we drop all country pairs with less than 1 or less than 3 first-time applications per quarter on average (see R15 and R16).

First-time application data is missing for Belgium in 2004, for Norway in 2002 and in quarter 2, 3 and 4 of 2007. Moreover, for France no data on first-time applications is available in 2008 and for Spain no first-time application data is available in 2008 and 2009. As Eurostat also provides monthly data on the number of total asylum applications from 2008 onwards, we use this information to impute the number of first-time applications in the missing quarters for France and Spain. To do so we first calculate the average share of first-time applications in all applications for all years in which both variables are available\footnote{In France that would be 2010 to 2014 and in Spain that would be 2009 to 2014.} separately for each origin country.\footnote{There are very few cases in which the number of first-time applications is larger than the number of total applications. In these cases we replace the share with 1, because first-time applications should be included in the number of all applications and thus this must be a mistake in the data.} In a next step we then use this origin-destination specific share to calculate the number of first-time applications from the number of total applications. In order to show that this imputation of first-time applications for France and Spain does not drive our results, we run a robustness check (R10) that treats 2008 and 2009 for France and 2008 for Spain as missing. For our main analysis and also for all further control variables that we calculate from the number of first-time application we use the imputed version. 



Our main dependent variable in the application analysis are the log first-time applications per capita. To calculate this we first add 1 to the number of first-time applications and then divide it by the population of the destination country, before taking the log. This procedure is also used for all other variables that we include as log per capita in our regressions. For an additional robustness we also create the log of the first-time applications per capita of the origin country in a similar way. As can be seen in robustness check R7 this doesn't change our results.

Moreover, we use data on applications and first-time applications to create some additional control variables. We use yearly data on total applications on the destination level to create the log of the average applications per capita in the previous 5 years.\footnote{We use yearly on total applications at the destination level, because for the years before 2008 no yearly first-time application data is available and the yearly data at the destination level is available already from 1997 onwards and has very few missings.} No data on yearly applications is available for Norway in 2007. We thus impute this by taking the average of the total applications in 2006 and 2008. For the United Kingdom application data is missing for the year 2008, however there is yearly first-time application available. We thus proxy the number of total applications in the UK in 2008 by using the number of first-time applications in that year. Before taking the log we then calculate the average applications in the previous 5 years, add 1 and divide it by the destination country population. 

We also use quarterly first-time applications both dyadic and on the destination level to create another 4 control variables which we use in some of the robustness checks. We calculate the following four variables and then take the log per capita as described earlier. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The average dyadic first-time applications of the past 1 to 6 quarters (if data is available the past 6 quarters, otherwise as many as are available).
	\item  The average total first-time applications on the destination level of the past 1 to 6 quarters (if data is available the past 6 quarters, otherwise as many as are available).
	\item The sum of the dyadic first-time applications in the previous 2 quarters (missing if one or both of the previous quarters is missing).
	\item The sum of the total first-time applications at destination level in the previous 2 quarters (missing if one or both of the previous quarters is missing).
\end{itemize}


For the decision analysis we then use a subset of the 12 destination countries for which also decision data is available in at least 44 out of the 52 quarters from Q1 2002 to Q4 2014. This leaves us with 9 destination countries, namely Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom. In an additional robustness check we also use a larger sample of destination countries in the decision analysis which we choose similar to the rules for the data on first-time asylum applications. We use only countries for which decision data is available in at least 44 out of the 52 quarters from Q1 2002 to Q4 2014. And then in a second step, we keep only countries that have in total at least 20000 asylum decisions in the time period 2002 to 2014. In addition to the 9 destination countries which are already in the baseline decision analysis we thus also include Austria, Finland, Greece and Hungary. 

Similarly to the 

Decision data is missing for Ireland and for Denmark in 2002, for France in 2007 and for Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom in quarter 4 of 2007. Moreover no decision data is available for the origin country Former Serbia and Montenegro.

\section{Robustness Checks for Application Analysis}
Our main result, that the number of asylum applicants under left- and right-wing parties converges before elections and differs thereafter,  is robust to various different specifications. In this online appendix present results for the following 18 robustness checks\footnote{Note that all robustness checks are based on the baseline fixed effects regression, which is presented in the paper. In this list of robustness checks we only explain the deviations from that baseline regression. If something is not explicitly mentioned, it can be assumed to be the same as in the baseline regression.}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 1}: In this robustness check we use separate fixed effects for destination and origin instead of a fixed effect for each destination-origin pair. This specification allows to include time-invariant bilateral variables in the regression, such as the distance between destination and origin country and the stock of migrants from a certain origin country in the destination country in 2001. In the regression both variables are included in logs. All other control variables are the same as in the baseline regression.  
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 2}: In this robustness check we use destination fixed effects as well as origin*time fixed effects. All time-variant origin country control variables are captured by the origin*time fixed effects and therefore not included in this specification. Similar to robustness check 1, this specification also allows to include time-invariant bilateral variables.  
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 3}: In this robustness check the log of the average total past asylum applications at destination per capita in the previous 5 years is included as an additional destination control variable. 
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 4}: In order to allow for different effects of left-wing and right-wing cabinets outside the election period, this robustness check includes a dummy which is equal to 1 if the incumbent cabinet is classified as right-wing.   
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 5}: In this robustness check we use the overall asylum policy index provided by Hatton (2017), which measures the strictness of asylum policies in destination countries as an additional control variable.
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 6}: In comparison to robustness check 5, in this robustness check we include the separate asylum policy indices for the areas access, welfare and processing. 
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 7}: In this specification we use the origin country population to calculate the number of first-time asylum applications per capita. The dependent variable is thus the log of the number of quarterly first-time asylum applications per capita in origin country.  
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 8}: As explained in detail in section A (data appendix) in the main specification we use lags to calculate the origin country control variables political terror scale, freedom house index, quarterly civil war battle death and log origin GDP per capita. In this robustness check we refrain from doing that and just include the value of the origin country control variables in the respective quarter.
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 9}: As explained in detail in section A (data appendix) we have two different data sources for the number of battle death in Syria. In this robustness check we use the measure which is based on the yearly data from the Upsalla Conflict Data Programm. (SOURCE) 
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 10}: As there have been some changes in the data collection method of the asylum data by Eurostat in 2008, in this robustness check we include a dummy which is equal to 1 if the year is 2008 or later and zero otherwise as an additional control variable. 
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 11}: In this robustness check we cluster standard errors on destination-origin level. 
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 12}: We don't have first-time asylum application data for France in 2008 and for Spain in 2008 and 2009. In this robustness check we do not impute the number of first-time asylum applications from the data on total asylum applications, but just leave them missing.   
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 13}:  In this robustness check we use a slightly different procedure to classify the position of the cabinet as left-wing or right-wing. Before creating the dummies we normalize the left-right position of the cabinet on the destination country level.
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 14}: In this robustness check we use yet another procedure to determine the position of the cabinet as left-wing or right-wing. All cabinets that have a value on the left-right scale lower than 5 are classified as left-wing and all cabinets that have a value on the left-right scale higher than 5 are classified as right-wing.
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 15}: For this robustness check we drop all country pairs that have on average less than 1 first-time applications per quarter. 
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 16}: For this robustness check we drop all country pairs that have on average less than 3 first-time applications per quarter. 
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 17}: In this robustness check we include the log of the average total first-time applications in the previous 6 quarters as an additional control.  
	 	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 18}: This robustness check uses only countries for which there is also data on asylum decisions. The destination countries Belgium, Netherlands and Norway are thus not included.

	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 8}: in this robustness check we control for the log of the average total and the log of the average dyadic first-time applications per capita in the previous 2 quarters.
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 9}: In this robustness check we cluster standard errors on destination-origin level Hungary.  
	
	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 10}: As there have been some changes in the data collection method of the asylum data by Eurostat in 2008, in this robustness check we include a dummy which is equal to 1 if the year is 2008 or later and zero otherwise as an additional control variable.

	\item \textbf{Robustness Check 12}: In this robustness check the destination country sample includes all large countries in terms of asylum decisions for which decision data is available in at least 44 out of the 52 quarters under analysis. The countries that are added are Austria, Finland, Greece and Hungary.

Significant coefficients are indicated by filled plot markers. Periods in which the two coefficients are significantly different from each other are indicated with a grey background. The navy dashed line in sub-figure R4 shows the average temporary protection rate under right-wing cabinets in periods outside the election period. Significance of the coefficients of the right-wing cabinet in sub-figure R4 is reported for the distance to this average non-election period effect.}
