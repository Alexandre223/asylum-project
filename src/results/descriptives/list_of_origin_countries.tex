		\multicolumn{4}{p{14.3cm}}{Note: Not all origin countries are in the sample of origin countries for all years 2002 to 2014. Former Serbia and Montenegro is only in the sample from 2002 to 2006. Serbia is in the sample from 2007 onwards and Kosovo is in the sample from 2009 onwards. When calculating the top 90\% origin countries we do not correct for the fact that these countries are not in the sample for the entire time period. For the decision analysis Former Serbia and Montenegro and Rwanda are not included in the sample of origin countries.}
